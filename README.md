RFPasswordStrength
==================

People wonder if their password is a good password. I often come across two distinct groups of people. The first would fall into a "just use any word" category, which is a very bad practice for picking passwords. The second group will mix in a few numbers in order to make the password a lot harder to guess. But, how do you know if you have a secure password?


## How To Get Started

1. Download RFPasswordStrength
2. `#import "RFPasswordStrength.h"`
3. Check your password strength using the class method:

    `[RFPasswordStrength checkPasswordStrengthWithPassword:@"YourPassword"];`
